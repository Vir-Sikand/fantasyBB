# fantasyBB
A flask and python project to help pick up fantasy basketball players off the waiver wire based on recent performance and league availability. 
Utilizes espn-api, as well as OpenAI API for league info retrieval and reccomendations. 

Screenshots of the login screen, position selection, and the top 10 player averages for small forwards with chatGPT's reccomendation for who to pick up as of 01/03/2024 are shown in the .png files in the "Demo Photos Folder". Your OpenAI api key must be placed in .env file in the root directory of the project.
